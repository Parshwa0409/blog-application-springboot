# Product Context: Understanding JWT Authentication

## 1. The Problem

The user has a Spring Boot application with a partial or unclear implementation of JWT-based authentication. They lack the foundational knowledge of how JWTs work, why certain components are necessary, and how the authentication flow operates in Spring Security. This prevents them from confidently extending, debugging, or managing the security layer of their application.

## 2. The Solution

This project aims to bridge that knowledge gap by providing a detailed, beginner-friendly explanation of the entire JWT authentication and authorization process. The final output should empower the user to:

- Understand the role of each component in their existing code.
- Grasp the end-to-end flow from user login to accessing a protected resource.
- Follow a clear, conceptual guide to implement JWT security in a Spring Boot application from scratch.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Clarity:** The explanation should be simple and avoid jargon where possible.
- **Conceptual First:** The user should understand the "why" before the "how."
- **Practical Connection:** All conceptual explanations must be tied back to the user's actual code.
- **Confidence Building:** The user should feel capable of managing and building upon their authentication system after this session.
