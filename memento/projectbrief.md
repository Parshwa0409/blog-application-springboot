# Project Brief: JWT Authentication in Spring Boot

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to thoroughly understand and document a JWT-based authentication system within a Spring Boot application. This involves analyzing existing code, explaining fundamental concepts to a beginner, and outlining the step-by-step process for implementing JWT authentication from scratch.

## 2. Core Requirements

- **Analyze Existing Code:** Review the provided Spring Boot project to understand its current implementation of JWT authentication.
- **Explain Core Concepts:** Provide a clear, beginner-friendly explanation of JWT, Spring Security, and how they work together.
- **Detail the Authentication Flow:** Describe the sequence of events in a JWT-based authentication and authorization process.
- **Provide a Step-by-Step Guide:** Create a conceptual guide for setting up JWT authentication in a new Spring Boot project.
- **Connect Concepts to Code:** Relate the theoretical explanations back to the specific classes and methods in the user's codebase.

## 3. Key Deliverables

- A comprehensive explanation of the JWT authentication process.
- An analysis of the important components in the existing codebase (`JwtAuthFilter`, `WebSecurityConfig`, `UserDetailsServiceImpl`, etc.).
- A conceptual guide for building a similar authentication system from the ground up.
- Complete and well-maintained Memento documentation to ensure project continuity.
